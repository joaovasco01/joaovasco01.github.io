## Abstract

In the digital age, personal data privacy has become a critical concern, driven by the proliferation of online platforms and the increasing volume of data storage. This thesis explores the challenges and methodologies surrounding **digital erasure**, focusing on compliance with privacy regulations such as **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA)**.

The research investigates **machine learning techniques**, particularly **Random Forest and Decision Tree classifiers**, to track, match, and prepare personal data for deletion across complex systems. By adapting **intrusion recovery methodologies**, this thesis proposes a system for accurately identifying and managing data marked for deletion, ensuring organizations meet regulatory obligations. The analysis demonstrates how machine learning models enhance data matching, focusing specifically on log identification as a crucial step in the broader process of data deletion.

This work contributes to the broader discourse on **data privacy** by addressing the practical challenges of **data management in distributed environments**, paving the way for a more **secure and compliant digital erasure framework**.
