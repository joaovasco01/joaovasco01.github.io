        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am <span class="highlight">João Vasco</span>, a final-year Master's student in <span class="highlight">Computer Science & Engineering</span> at <span class="highlight">Instituto Superior Técnico</span>, specializing in <span class="highlight">Data Science</span> and <span class="highlight">Artificial Intelligence</span>. As a passionate <span class="highlight">Data Science Researcher</span>, I have honed my skills in a range of cutting-edge technologies and methodologies. Current Master's <span class="highlight">GPA 3.91/4.5 </span></p>
        <p>In my professional pursuits, I've embraced roles that challenge and expand my expertise. As a Teaching Assistant at the University of Lisbon, I have contributed to the field of Human-Computer Interaction. My tenure as a Frontend Web Developer at Thales showcased my capability to develop innovative solutions within the Innovation Hub Development sector. Moreover, my involvement in a training program in Solidity has equipped me with deep insights into smart contract audits, game theory, and network security, with a specific focus on Ethereum and Bitcoin.</p>
        <p>My commitment to growth extends beyond academics and professional endeavors. As an athlete with the Portuguese Federation of Tennis and a National Teamgym Champion, I have developed a discipline and resilience that fuel my drive for data science excellence. Furthermore, my fluency in Portuguese, Spanish, and English allows me to communicate effectively in a global context. I look forward to bringing my diverse skill set and unique perspectives to create impactful solutions in the field of data science.</p>

            <h3>Master Thesis: How to Disappear Online</h3>
            <p>My thesis, titled "How to Disappear Online", explores the intricate concepts of digital erasure and personal privacy in the information age. It delves into the implications of the GDPR's "Right to be Forgotten", data sanitization practices, and the challenges of ensuring complete data erasure in a world of pervasive digital footprints. The thesis also examines various data recovery techniques, contrasting them with the need for effective digital erasure, and proposes new methodologies for ensuring personal privacy in the digital realm.</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">Focus Areas:</span> Personal Privacy, Digital Erasure, GDPR Compliance, Data Recovery Techniques</p>
