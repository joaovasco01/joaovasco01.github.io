## Teaching & Mentorship
As an instructor for the **Human-Computer Interaction** course at [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/IPM23/2023-2024/2-semestre), my primary focus is on providing students with a comprehensive understanding of how technology interacts with human behavior. Teaching a diverse group of 48 students from five different countries, I aim to foster a collaborative and inclusive learning environment.
