## Overview
This experiment explores how different language variations impact AI-generated outputs. Using **200 prompts**, three bilingual evaluators assessed AI-generated images based on prompts in different languages.

## Experiment Setup
- **Original English prompt**
- **Portuguese prompt written by a native Portuguese speaker studying English Studies**
- **Portuguese prompt translated back to English using widn.ai**

### Key Findings
- **84 images** from original English prompts were deemed most accurate.
- **82 images** from the translated prompts were considered the best.
- **Only 34 images** from the original Portuguese prompts matched evaluator expectations.

### How It Worked
- Each prompt generated **three images**, one for each language variation.
- **Bilingual evaluators** (native Portuguese speakers) assessed which image best represented the prompt.

### Example Prompt
#### **English (TEXT A):**
*A lush tropical rainforest scene at sunrise, with sunlight filtering through the dense canopy. A vibrant blue-and-yellow macaw is perched on a moss-covered branch, surrounded by hanging vines and orchids in full bloom. In the background, a small waterfall cascades into a crystal-clear pool, where two deer are drinking water. The atmosphere is serene and filled with mist.*

#### **Portuguese (TEXT B):**
*Uma cena luxuosa de uma floresta tropical ao amanhecer, com a luz solar refletindo-se na densa copa das árvores. Em primeiro plano, uma arara azul e amarela vibrante está suspensa num ramo coberto de musgo, rodeada por trepadeiras suspensas e orquídeas em plena floração. Uma pequena cascata deságua numa piscina de água límpida, onde dois veados se banham. A atmosfera é tranquila e repleta de neblina.*

#### **Translated Back to English (TEXT C) via Widn.Ai:**
*A luxurious scene of a tropical forest at dawn, with sunlight reflecting off the dense canopy of trees. In the foreground, a vibrant blue and yellow macaw is perched on a moss-covered branch, surrounded by hanging vines and orchids in full bloom. A small waterfall flows into a pool of clear water, where two deer are bathing. The atmosphere is serene and misty.*

### Observations
- The **English original and translated prompts** produced nearly identical results.
- The **original Portuguese prompts** led to significantly lower accuracy in image selection.
- **Language structure impacts AI interpretation**, influencing output quality.

## Conclusion
This experiment underscores the importance of **writing AI prompts in English** for the most accurate and consistent results. The findings also suggest that **translation tools still struggle with nuanced prompts** used in AI image generation.
