## Overview
This study focuses on the classification of hotel reviews as either truthful or deceptive. Various machine learning models were evaluated to determine their effectiveness in identifying deceptive reviews.

## Key Topics

### Models Used
- **Linear Support Vector Classifier (Linear SVC):** The best-performing model, effectively identifying deception.
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier:** Sequential decision trees for improving classification accuracy.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Classifies based on the similarity of neighboring data points.
- **Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes:** A probabilistic classifier useful for multi-class text classification.

### Preprocessing Steps
- Converted text to lowercase for uniformity.
- Tokenized and lemmatized words while filtering stopwords.
- Retained punctuation due to its significance in sentiment analysis.

### Experimental Results
- Dataset: 1400 hotel reviews classified as Truthful Positive (TP), Truthful Negative (TN), Deceptive Positive (DP), and Deceptive Negative (DN).
- **Linear SVC achieved the highest accuracy at 87.86%.**
- Gradient Boosting (69.93%), KNN (64.29%), and MultinomialNB (79.29%) performed lower.

### Analysis of Misclassifications
- The study identified key phrases that led to incorrect classifications.
- Certain exaggerations and strong emotions misled the classifier.
- Ambiguous statements affected accuracy.

### Future Work
- Improve preprocessing by handling colloquialisms and uncommon terms.
- Refine dataset alignment by reassessing questionable labels.
- Explore deep learning approaches (RNNs, LSTMs, Transformer models).
- Implement data augmentation techniques to enhance dataset robustness.

## Conclusion
The study demonstrates that **Linear SVC is the most effective model** for classifying truthful and deceptive hotel reviews. Future improvements could include enhanced preprocessing and deep learning methods to boost performance.
