## Overview
Modern software often integrates multiple programming languages, increasing complexity and security vulnerabilities. This paper investigates how known sanitizers can be adapted to detect and mitigate cross-language call vulnerabilities.

## Key Topics

### Cross Language Attacks (CLA)
- **Problem:** Different languages have distinct security assumptions, leading to vulnerabilities when interacting.
- **Example:** A Rust program calling C functions via Foreign Function Interface (FFI) may compromise Rustâ€™s memory safety.
- **Attack Method:** Attackers exploit mismatched security models between languages to perform attacks impossible within a single language.

### Existing Sanitizers
- **AddressSanitizer (ASAN):** Detects memory errors like buffer overflows, out-of-bounds access, and use-after-free in C/C++.
- **Findings:** ASAN and other sanitizers (LeakSanitizer, ThreadSanitizer, etc.) do not effectively detect CLA vulnerabilities.
- **Challenges:** Cross-language function calls bypass sanitization mechanisms, leading to undetected exploits.

### Proposed Solutions
- **Prevent Unintended Interactions:** Isolating components in separate processes or virtualizing them (e.g., Sandcrust for Rust).
- **Securing Intended Interactions:** Implementing sanitizers to monitor inter-language calls and detect anomalies.
- **Sanitizer Extension:** Expanding ASAN with shadow memory mapping to store metadata about memory boundaries and freed resources across languages.

### Future Work
- **Implementation of Extended ASAN:** Develop and test a cross-language sanitizer in real-world scenarios.
- **Security Validation:** Evaluate effectiveness in detecting and preventing cross-language attacks.

## Conclusion
Current sanitizers fail to address CLA vulnerabilities effectively. Extending sanitizers like ASAN with shared metadata tracking can improve security. Cross-language sanitization will be essential for modern multi-language applications.
