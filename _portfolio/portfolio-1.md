## Overview  
This project focuses on sentiment analysis, applying **Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to classify text sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Features  
- **Preprocessing pipeline:** Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization  
- **Modeling:** Implemented using classifiers like NaÃ¯ve Bayes, SVM, and LSTMs  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices  
- **Dataset:** Utilizes labeled datasets for supervised learning  

## Repository  
ðŸ”— **GitHub Repo:** [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/joaovasco01/SentimentAnalysis)  

## Installation & Usage  
Clone the repository and install dependencies:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joaovasco01/SentimentAnalysis.git
cd SentimentAnalysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the model:  
```bash
python train.py
```

## Example  
Below is a sample output from the model predicting the sentiment of a review:  
```
Input: "The product is amazing and works flawlessly!"
Predicted Sentiment: Positive  
```

## Future Improvements  
- Fine-tuning models with larger datasets  
- Enhancing explainability with SHAP/LIME  
- Expanding to multi-language sentiment analysis
