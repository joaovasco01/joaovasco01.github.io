## **Photography & Creative Exploration**  
Photography started as a curiosity about **image processing and AI-generated visuals**—technologies like **Stable Diffusion** fascinated me.  
However, I soon realized that **photography itself is an art beyond the tech side**.  

I became particularly drawn to **film photography**, a medium where every frame carries a distinct texture, grain, and organic imperfection—qualities that digital AI struggles to replicate. The scarcity of structured data on **film-based photography** presents an exciting challenge, further fueling my interest in this field.
